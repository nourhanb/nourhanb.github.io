I am primarily interested in the application of deep learning techniques to classification tasks in medical image analysis, with a particular emphasis on analyzing skin lesion images. My research interests revolve around advancing the field by improving the lifelong learning and generalization capabilities of deep neural networks.


**Improving Lifelong Learning of Deep Networks**

My research is dedicated to enhancing the lifelong learning capabilities of deep neural networks. By continually improving their ability to adapt to new information and scenarios, we aim to unlock the potential for lifelong learning in these networks. Our focus is on empowering deep networks to seamlessly acquire new knowledge and skills over time while capitalizing on their existing knowledge to facilitate enhanced performance.


**Improving Generalization of Deep Networks on out-of-distribution (OOD) Data**

A significant aspect of our research is addressing the challenge of generalization on out-of-distribution data. We strive to equip deep networks with the necessary mechanisms to transcend the limitations imposed by unfamiliar or unseen data distributions. Through the development of new methodologies, our goal is to bolster their ability to generalize effectively, even in the face of diverse and heterogeneous datasets.

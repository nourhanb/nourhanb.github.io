Hello! I'm a fourth-year PhD student at the University of British Columbia, specializing in AI for medical imaging within the Biomedical Signal and Image Computing Laboratory [(BiSICL)](https://bisicl.ece.ubc.ca/). My research is supported by the prestigious NSERC PhD Vanier fellowship, focusing on advancing lifelong learning and domain generalization in deep networks for medical applications. I am privileged to be mentored by Professor [Rafeef Garbi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Mwscz1IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and collaborate with Professor [Ghassan Hamarneh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=61DdlkAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) from the Medical Image Analysis Laboratory [(MIA)](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/) at Simon Fraser University.

I have extensive experience in teaching, curriculum development and lab management. Iâ€™ve served as an instructor, lab engineer, workshop engineer, teaching assistant and private tutoring. My skills include developing training materials, conducting needs assessments, grading, managing lab equipment, supervising projects, and implementing safety protocols. I'm also adept at delivering high-standard training, creating flexible assessment tools, and enhancing online and in-person learning environments. In addition to academia, I have gained industrial experience as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [Cognia AI](https://www.cognia.ca/) during my PhD and as an HPC Expert Intern at [Ankabut](https://www.ankabut.ae/) during my undergraduate studies.

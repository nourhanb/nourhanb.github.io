Greetings! I am a fourth-year PhD student specializing in AI for medical imaging at the Biomedical Signal and Image Computing Laboratory [(BiSICL)](https://bisicl.ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. My research is generously funded by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) through the prestigious PhD Vanier fellowship. I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Professor [Rafeef Garbi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Mwscz1IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and I collaborate closely with Professor [Ghassan Hamarneh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=61DdlkAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) from the Medical Image Analysis Laboratory [(MIA)](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/) at Simon Fraser University. My primary focus revolves around enhancing the lifelong learning capabilities and domain generalization of deep networks for medical applications. I have a Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Khalifa University (2015, UAE). I also hold a [Level 3 certificate in Assessing Vocationally Related Achievement from NCFE](https://www.ncfe.org.uk/qualification-search/qualification-detail/ncfe-level-3-certificate-in-assessing-vocational-achievement-515) (2018, UK).

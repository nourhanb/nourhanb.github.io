Greetings! I am a third-year PhD student specializing in AI for medical imaging at the Biomedical Signal and Image Computing Laboratory [(BiSICL)](https://bisicl.ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. My research is generously funded by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) through the prestigious PhD Vanier fellowship. I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Professor Rafeef Garbi, and I collaborate closely with Professor Ghassan Hamarneh from the Medical Image Analysis [(MIA)](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/) Laboratory at Simon Fraser University. My primary focus revolves around enhancing the lifelong learning capabilities and domain generalization of deep networks for medical applications. I have a Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Khalifa University (2015, UAE). I also hold a Level 3 certificate in Assessing Vocationally Related Achievement from NCFE (2018, UK).
